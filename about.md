I am a developer. This site is created on the Boxing Day of 2016. 2016 was a very tough year for me.

### More Information

Basically I am a football fan (well, I mean soccer). As I grow older I am more of a fan of football itself than some kind of die-hard fan of a player or a team. But still Manchester United has a spot there.
